## **introduction**

We made the application what it can be classification the waste garbage with the model from machine learning using tensorflow and the model results  embedded in Mobile development. 
We hope our project provide benefits to the wide society. 
This application that we made named Tresh.

## Our Repository
**Mobile Development**

**Machine Learning**

**Cloud Computing**

## Dataset

We use dataset about waste Classification, garbage collection, and recycle and nonrecycle garbage to build and train the Model. We use dataset from kaggle, there is:

* Garbage Classification (12 Classes)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification

* Waste Classification data v2
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sapal6/waste-classification-data-v2

* Non and Biodegradable Material Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rayhanzamzamy/non-and-biodegradable-waste-dataset 

Our Dataset divided by 2 classes (Recycle and Non-recycle)
This is the Pie chart of dataset

We made a dataset with train set and data set. We made **29592 images** belonging 2 classes (recycle and non recycle) for train set and we made **2975 images** belonging 2 classes for test set


## Build the Model

Our model is succesfully with 
* loss          : 0.3599
* Val_loss      : 0.3177
* Accuracy      : 0.8291
* Val_accuracy  : 0.8571

## Our project future

* Build UI/UX consist of developing the app even further and adding the description about recycle and Non-recycle.
* Adding the save button in the app to save the decsription about the waste garbage you scan before
* Market Research
* Maintenace our system and server
* Deploying our app in the public
* Evaluation from critic and suggestion
* Launching the feature app and service
